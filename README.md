# Power Platform Challenge

To build an app to help building inspectors to complete their day to day tasks. The City of Santa Monica publishes their Building Permit Inspection Schedule as open data. Building inspectors need to travel to various locations throughout the day to inspect building that are under construction. Building inspector supervisors need to ensure timely delivery of services and analyze overall trends. The app will help Building and Safety Division manage their requests for building permit inspections.
